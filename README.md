# Script Repository

This repository contains various scripts used for processing genomic data, particularly focusing on genotyping, region selection, and sample handling. Below is a brief description of each file and its purpose.

## Files and Descriptions

### `GQ_2.py`
This script retains the sample with the highest Genotype Quality (GQ) for each genomic region.

**Usage:**
```python
python GQ_2.py
```

### `GT.py`
This script checks and processes the genotype information for each sample, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

**Usage:**
```python
python GT.py
```

### `carrier_non.sh`
A shell script that selects a carrier and a non-carrier sample for each genomic region. This is useful for comparative analysis between different genotypes.

**Usage:**
```bash
bash carrier_non.sh
```

### `carriers_GT.py`
Processes and manages the genotypes of carrier samples. (Provide more details if available)

**Usage:**
```python
python carriers_GT.py
```

### `merged_300.vcf`
This is the output file generated by the `SURVIVOR` tool after merging remapped regions. It contains the merged VCF data for further analysis.

### `non_carrier.py`
An older version of the `carrier_non.sh` script that was used to select carrier and non-carrier samples for each region.

**Usage:**
```python
python non_carrier.py
```

### `regions_10kb.py`
This script filters and retains only the genomic regions that are smaller than 10 kilobases (kb).

**Usage:**
```python
python regions_10kb.py
```

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Each script can be executed in a Python environment, and the shell script can be run directly in a Unix-like terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/celiatsapalou/Pseudopool_script.git
cd Pseudopool_script
```

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system to run the Python scripts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Bash shell (for running `carrier_non.sh`)
- Dependencies as required by specific Python scripts (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, etc.)

## Usage

Each script can be run independently based on your specific needs. Refer to the descriptions above for the usage of each file.
